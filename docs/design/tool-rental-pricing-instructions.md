# How Tool Rental Prices Are Calculated

## Setting Rental Prices

1. Owners determine all rental prices for their tools.

2. Owners can set daily, weekly, and monthly rental rates.

## Calculating Total Rental Cost

3. The total rental cost is calculated using a tiered approach:
   - First, count the number of full months and multiply by the monthly price
   - Then, count the remaining full weeks and multiply by the weekly price. The toal of weeks price is capped at the monthly price.
   - Finally, count the remaining days and multiply by the daily price. The total of days price is capped at the weekly price.
   - The sum of these three amounts equals the total rental cost

## Pricing Recommendations

4. For optimal and competitive pricing, it's recommended to set the weekly price at 4-5 times the daily rate and the monthly price at 3 times the weekly rate.

5. When an owner first sets a daily price, the system automatically calculates the weekly price as 5 times the daily rate and the monthly price as 3 times the weekly rate. Owners can modify these suggested prices at any time. Subsequent price changes will not trigger automatic recalculation.

## Rental Duration Units

6. Owners can specify which duration unit applies to their tool: day, week, or month.
    - **Month unit**: Rental duration is rounded up to the nearest full month. Weekly and daily prices are ignored.
    - **Week unit**: Rental duration is rounded up to the nearest full week. Daily prices are ignored.
    - **Day unit**: The standard tiered calculation (point 4 above) applies.

## Replacement and Damage Costs

7. Owners can set a replacement cost for each tool. If a tool is lost or damaged beyond repair, the owner may charge this replacement cost to the renter. Owners may also charge reasonable repair fees at their discretion if a tool is returned with unusual wear or damage.
8. The system defaults the replacement cost to three months rental cost when user first time setting the rental price. Owners can change afterwards.

## Agreement to Terms

8. By confirming approval of a rental request, renters automatically accept the prices set by the owner, unless the owner specifies alternative terms in the approval note.
